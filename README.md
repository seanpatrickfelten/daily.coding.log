These are daily typed entries in the Daily Coding Log for the #100DaysOfCode.

<h2>Day 01</h2>

In the first day of the #100DaysOfCode, I learned how to write and use HTML codes for websites. For me, this was a refresher as I have taken GRC 15 class at Fresno City College (Web Page Design I).

I am very excited about the materials I am learning in the Free Code Camp.

<h2>Day 02</h2>

Today, I learned the rest of the refresher material on HTML codes by learning how to add a submit button to a form, using HTML5 to require a field, radio buttons, adding in a set of checkboxes, adding in check radio buttons and checkboxes by default, using a div element, and the head and body of an HTML document. In Day 03, I will be learning CSS. #100DaysOfCode

<h2>Day 03</h2>

I learned how to create a more complex shape using CSS and HTML, how the CSS @keyframes and animation properties work, button color changes when mouse is hovering over it, creating movement using CSS animation, fading an element from left to right, and animating elements continually using an infinite animation count. #100DaysOfCode

<h2>Day 09</h2>

I learned how bezier curves work, used a bezier curve to move a graphic, and made motion more natural using a bezier curve. The Visual Design Challenges are complete. Now, I am working on Applied Accessibility Challenges. #100DaysOfCode

<h2>Day 10</h2>

I am now working on Applied Accessibility Challenges. I learned when alt text should be left blank, used headings to show hierarchical relationships of content, and jumped straight to the content using the main element. #100DaysOfCode

<h2>Day 11</h2>

Using HTML5 - Made screen reader navigation easier with the header landmark, used the nav landmark, used the footer landmark, improved the accessibility of audio content with the audio element, and improved chart accessibility with the figure element. #100DaysOfCode
