These are daily typed entries in the Daily Coding Log for the #100DaysOfCode.

<h2>Day 01</h2>

In the first day of the #100DaysOfCode, I learned how to write and use HTML codes for websites. For me, this was a refresher as I have taken GRC 15 class at Fresno City College (Web Page Design I).

I am very excited about the materials I am learning in the Free Code Camp.
