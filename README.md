These are daily typed entries in the Daily Coding Log for the #100DaysOfCode.

<h2>Day 01</h2>

In the first day of the #100DaysOfCode, I learned how to write and use HTML codes for websites. For me, this was a refresher as I have taken GRC 15 class at Fresno City College (Web Page Design I).

I am very excited about the materials I am learning in the Free Code Camp.

<h2>Day 02</h2>

Today, I learned the rest of the refresher material on HTML codes by learning how to add a submit button to a form, using HTML5 to require a field, radio buttons, adding in a set of checkboxes, adding in check radio buttons and checkboxes by default, using a div element, and the head and body of an HTML document. In Day 03, I will be learning CSS. #100daysOfCode

<h2>Day 03</h2>

I am now learning CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). This involves CSS and CSS elements. So far, I learned how to set an id of an element, changed the background color of a form, adjusting the padding and margin of an element, and adjusting a negative margin. #100DaysOfCode

<h2>Day04</h2>

I learned various aspects of CSS. I learned to style the HTML body element, prioritize one style over another, override styles in CSS, declaration with inlline styles, using hex code for colors, using RGB values, and using a custom CSS variable. #100DaysOfCode
