These are daily typed entries in the Daily Coding Log for the #100DaysOfCode.

<h2>Day 01</h2>

In the first day of the #100DaysOfCode, I learned how to write and use HTML codes for websites. For me, this was a refresher as I have taken GRC 15 class at Fresno City College (Web Page Design I).

I am very excited about the materials I am learning in the Free Code Camp.

<h2>Day 02</h2>

Today, I learned the rest of the refresher material on HTML codes by learning how to add a submit button to a form, using HTML5 to require a field, radio buttons, adding in a set of checkboxes, adding in check radio buttons and checkboxes by default, using a div element, and the head and body of an HTML document. In Day 03, I will be learning CSS. #100DaysOfCode

<h2>Day 03</h2>

I am now learning CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). This involves CSS and CSS elements. So far, I learned how to set an id of an element, changed the background color of a form, adjusting the padding and margin of an element, and adjusting a negative margin. #100DaysOfCode

<h2>Day 04</h2>

I learned various aspects of CSS. I learned to style the HTML body element, prioritize one style over another, override styles in CSS, declaration with inlline styles, using hex code for colors, using RGB values, and using a custom CSS variable. #100DaysOfCode

<h2>Day 05</h2>

I learned the rest of the aspects of CSS and now I am learning an introduction to the applied visual design challenges. #100DaysOfCode

<h2>Day 06</h2>

I learned to create visual balance (text-align), setting the width, adjusting the height of an element, making the text bold with the strong tag, using u tag (underline text)/em tag (italicize text)/s (strikethrough text)/using hr (horizontal lines), adjusting the background-color property of text, and decreasing the opacity of an element. #100DaysOfCode

<h2>Day 07</h2>

I learned about z-index, centering an element with margin property, complementary colors, tertiary colors, creating a gradual CSS linear gradient, using a CSS linear gradient to create a striped element, creating a texture by adding a subtle pattern as a background image, using the CSS transform scale property to change the size of an element, using the CSS transform scale property to scale property to scale an element on hover, using the CSS transform property skewX to skew an element along the x-axis, using the CSS transform property skewY to skew an element along the y-axis, and creating a graphic using CSS. #100DaysOfCode

<h2>Day 08</h2>

I learned how to create a more complex shape using CSS and HTML, how the CSS @keyframes and animation properties work, button color changes when mouse is hovering over it, creating movement using CSS animation, fading an element from left to right, and animating elements continually using an infinite animation count. #100DaysOfCode

<h2>Day 09</h2>

I learned how bezier curves work, used a bezier curve to move a graphic, and made motion more natural using a bezier curve. The Visual Design Challenges are complete. Now, I am working on Applied Accessibility Challenges. #100DaysOfCode
